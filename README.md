## Description

In the game "From Weak to Strong," players take on the role of an ordinary person who must embark on a journey to confront two adversaries. The game follows a turn-based battle system, allowing players to attack and defend. However, unlike typical games, items cannot be used during battles. When defending, there is a random chance of success. If the defense is unsuccessful, the player's armor and HP will be reduced accordingly. If a player uses only defense repeatedly, they will be vulnerable to direct attacks. However, when a player's HP is reduced to a minimum, they have a chance to perform a critical hit, with the damage being randomly multiplied by their ATK.

When a player wins a battle, they receive money and stat points to upgrade their attributes and purchase items to increase their HP and armor. If a player loses, everything is reset, and the goal of the game is to finish as quickly as possible while being cautious about upgrading attributes.
